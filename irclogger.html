<h2>What is irclogger</h2>
irclogger is a simple "bot", a program connecting as a client on IRC servers
    to provide a web log of what is said. It aims to provide a simple and
    web-compliant service. This page is at 
<a href='http://koala.ilog.fr/irclogger'>http://koala.ilog.fr/irclogger</a>
<h3>Goals</h3>
Irclogger was done to:
<ul>
<li><b>Be used on intranets</b>, where users can be trusted and will not try
	constantly to crack the system. Thus the bot do not need to provide
	the plethora of anti-hackers, channel defending measures
<li><b>Provide privacy</b>, users can set passwords on the log files, change
	them, but cannot remove them
<li><b>Be another web tool</b>, the bot obey just the minimal IRC commands
	to log or not a channel. All the rest is done via a web browser.
	Each logged phrase becomes a part of the web with its own URL.
</ul>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
I could not find a bot satisfying these criteria. All were huge monsters with
    bloated functionalities of dubious utility, many were disgusting amounts
    of ugly perl code.
<p>
I stumbled on a nice unfinished python bot "logger" by Sean B. Palmer and Dan
Connolly, so I just used it as a base for irclogger.
<p>
irclogger consists of 2 parts:
<ul>
<li><b>irclogger</b>, a python IRC client writing text logs in the MIRC
	format.
<li><b>CGI shell scripts</b>, (bash) to be used from a web server to format
	the logs into html and provide searching in them.
</ul>
