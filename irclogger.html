<h2>What is irclogger</h2>
irclogger is a simple "bot", a program connecting as a client on IRC servers
    to provide a web log of what is said. It aims to provide a simple and
    web-compliant service. This page is at 
<a
   href='http://colas.nahaboo.net/software/irclogger'>http://colas.nahaboo.net/software/irclogger</a>

<h3>Goals</h3>
Irclogger was done to:
<ul>
<li><b>Be used on intranets</b>, where users can be trusted and will not try
	constantly to crack the system. Thus the bot do not need to provide
	the plethora of anti-hackers, channel defending measures
<li><b>Provide privacy</b>, users can set passwords on the log files, change
	them, but cannot remove them
<li><b>Be another web tool</b>, the bot obey just the minimal IRC commands
	to log or not a channel. All the rest is done via a web browser.
	Each logged phrase becomes a part of the web with its own URL.
</ul>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
I could not find a bot satisfying these criteria. All were huge monsters with
    bloated functionalities of dubious utility, many were disgusting amounts
    of ugly perl code.
<p>
I stumbled on a nice unfinished python bot 
"<a href='http://miscoranda.com/38'>logger</a>" by Sean B. Palmer and Dan
Connolly, so I used it as a base for irclogger, and added html view of the
logs.
<p>
irclogger consists of 2 parts:
<ul>
<li><b>irclogger</b>, a python IRC client writing text logs in the MIRC
	format.
<li><b>CGI shell scripts</b>, (bash) to be used from a web server to format
	the logs into html and provide searching in them.
</ul>

<h2>User manual</h2> 

<b>irclogger</b> appears just as another user chatting on the IRC server and
channels, with the name <tt>[LOGGER]</tt>. You use it by talking to it, just
like another user, with the <tt>/msg</tt> command on most clients, or open
a private discussion from the menus.

<ul>
<li><b>To start logging a channel</b> "#foo", either:
<ul><li><b>invite</b> the bot to the channel. In channel #foo, type:
<br><tt>/invite&nbsp;[LOGGER]</tt>
<br>Depending on the server configuration, you may
not have the rights to do this, so just use the second solution:
<li><b>tell it to log</b> the channel, by sending it a private messages
"log&nbsp;channel", i.e. 
<br><tt>/msg&nbsp;[LOGGER]&nbsp;log&nbsp;#foo</tt>
<br>If the channel is password protected by a key, say "bar", you must append it,
e.g: <br><tt>/msg&nbsp;[LOGGER]&nbsp;log&nbsp;#foo&nbsp;bar</tt>
<br>
</ul>
<li><b>To stop logging a channel</b>, you can use any operation to remove a
user, or just say in the channel:
<tt>[LOGGER]&nbsp;off</tt>

<li><b>To type a non-logged line</b>, just prefix it by <b>[off]</b>, as in:
<tt>[off]&nbsp;well,&nbsp;it&nbsp;sucks&nbsp;:-)</tt>

<li><b>To get online help</b>, just say anything directly to the bot in a
private message
</ul>

<p><b>Web logs</b> Each logged line has its own permanent URL, that you can
get by clicking on the time. It will be of the form
<tt>http://...?date=...&amp;sel=<b>line</b>#topline</tt> (topline = line -4).
You can select a range of
lines to refer to from other web pages by adding by hand the ending line of the
	      range to the url, as:
<tt>http://...?date=...&amp;sel=line<b>-lastline</b>#topline</tt>, e.g:
<tt>http://...?date=...&amp;sel=<b>27-43</b>#23</tt>


<h2>Privacy</h2>
The bot only logs when you can see it in the user list as user
"<b>[LOGGER]</b>". If you do not see it, it cannot log you. The bot do not log
newly created channels, it has to be explicitely invited to log them. 
The bot writes a very visible message in the channel when starting and
stopping logging a channel.
<p>
Editing logs is easy for an admin as they are only plain text files on the
server. A future version may allow editing of the logs by users from the web.
<p>
Users can decide to password-protect the web logs. Once protected the log 
cannot be made unprotected again. Some channels can be declared public by the
administrator, which forbids users to password-protect them.
