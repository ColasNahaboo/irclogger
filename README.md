# Irclogger

irclogger is a simple "bot", a program connecting as a client on IRC  servers to provide a web log of what is said. It aims to provide a  simple, fast, efficient and web-compliant service. It is quite robust  and mature, having be in daily heavy use for personal & business use since 2003. This page is at https://colas.nahaboo.net/Code/IrcLogger.

## Goals 

-  **Be used on intranets**, where users can be trusted  and will not try constantly to crack the system. Thus the bot do not  need to provide the plethora of anti-hackers, channel defending measures
-  **Provide privacy**, users can set passwords on the log files, change them, but cannot remove them
-  **Be another web tool**, the bot obeys just the  minimal IRC commands to log or not a channel. All the rest is done via a web browser. Each logged phrase becomes a part of the web with its own  URL.
