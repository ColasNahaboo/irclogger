1.8a 06 Nov 2003
    cgi scripts: uses the $FORM_var system of bashlib rather than the
        `param var` form which seemed to have problems on some machines
1.8 23 Oct 2003
    irclogger: on exit (^C or kill or disconnection) save the list of 
        monitored channels (space-separated list) in file LOG/CHANNELS.last, 
	so that (the new) irclogger-run can reconnect to them on startup.
	No need to restart irclogger if you do not need this feature.
    you will need to update your existing installed irclogger-run scripts with
        the provided patches/irclogger-run-1.8
1.7 23 Oct 2003
    irclogger: forces all channel names to lowercase, ignores previously made
        dirs that were not lowercase. You will have to rename them by hand
	before re-running irclogger.
	This was needed, otherwise if people created channels TWiki and then
	Twiki, the logs were in different dirs although they were the same IRC
	channels.
	No need to restart irclogger if you do not need this feature.
    added a small log converter from xchat format to mirc/irclogger one,
        xchat-to-mirc

    html: new output format: TWiki (makes definition lists in TWiki)
        done by new file (cgi bash)  irclogger_totwiki
    Update instructions: make a symbolic link to this file from the BIN dirs:
        in all BINs, do a: ln -s /usr/local/irclogger/irclogger_totwiki .
1.6 21 Oct 2003
    Minor fixs: (python) online bot help gives the URL of the logs
    Niceties to the html page (user manual)
    Decided to go to a major/minor version numbering (no changes to python
        on minor versions)

    install script
    irclogger change: log message put in a single line to avoid flooding
         server on startup when initially logging many channels
1.3 04 Oct 2003
    BIN/irclogger.conf variable confdir renamed as logsdir
    (you need to rename the variable in your existing config files when 
    upgrading)
1.2 13 Sep 2003
    should now quit properly on deconnections and not hang indefinitely:
        modified loop code to emit a ping every 60s (tick)
    do not log mess to self even if not the same case
    html: proper per week separation, sunday & saturday smaller

    Putting a file PUBLIC in a channel log dir makes it unprotectable
