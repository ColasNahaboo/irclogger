interface with cgiirc:
   * list logged chans in select box on start
   * link to cgiirc to directly jump into a channel from web irclooger pages

Allow uploading raw files to allow download/edit/upload sequence.
See: http://starship.python.net/crew/lutz/Basics/putfile.html
or by wiki-like edition:
   * chan dirs and topdir are to be made a+rw (install, update, from irclogger)
   * on edit, lock (ln to .lock file), copy buffer to memory, count lines N
     store in hidden vars N & date
     make it a+rw
     create a a+rw .lockwho with IP date and other printable info
     warn in interface to cancel lock, and that there is no backup
     if locked print a message telling to go to admin with .lockwho contents
     offer to break lock (remove .lock .lockwho)
   * on save, check .lockwho for date if not, refuse to save, and propose to 
     back in browser, copy/paste, do a merge by hand
     save in another files .new then .oldlines (with N)
     make them a+rw
     on save, join lines not beginning by [hh:mm] 
   * append chan name to a EDITS_PENDING file global for all chans
   * irclogger, on tick look for EDITS_PENDING. if exists, remove it
     then looks in all chanss listed in it 
     for all .oldlines files and perform the merge:
     .new + (.log - N), then remove .new & .oldlines and .lock
     (inside a while loop looking for EDITS_PENDING existence)
   * provide a way to make logs non editable (file NOEDIT in logs)

allow search in multiple channels (shell-wilcardable list of dirs). 
    take care of passwd-protected ones

allow grep via fgrep / egrep / agrep
