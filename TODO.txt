fix the URLs in the code from koala.ilog.fr to new

interface with cgiirc:
   * list logged chans in select box on start
   * link to cgiirc to directly jump into a channel from web irclogger pages

log editing:
   * provide a way to make logs non editable (file NOEDIT in logs)
   * only allow censorship of a line
implementation (cleaner):
   * have the irclogger python daemon listen on a socket for orders to
     edit/clear ranges of lines, and make the UI connect to it. socket could 
     be either:
      * an http server
      * or an order in an IRC message

allow selecting start and end of select range in html form
cropping: another parameter to restrict view to range (without highlight)
allow range/sel to be seleted by time: HH:MM[.relativeline]
make cropping work for text and twiki views

work with channels given in mixed case in URLs
    http://loggerurl/mbsAccounting  just map it down to mbsaccounting

allow all legal chars in channel names (including dots)

Use via URL:
%INCLUDE{http://koala.ilog.fr/twikiirc/bin/irclogger_logs/mbssrc}%
 be able to set your own help text?
 date, lines, recorded conversations + own help header and
 footer would be cool.
url params to disable head & foot (or clear markers)

search:
 do not serach in times (and optionally nicks) 

like style.css, provide facilities to include header & footer

<SamHasler> Colas_, have a &user=SamH parameter and then colour code the HTML
log to highlight the part of the log when users with than pattern weren't in
the channel

Adding by hand a / to the end of the URL .../irclogger_logs breaks the list of
channels, as the links to the channel get an extra irclogger_logs component

RSS Feeds (idea by Marc Laporte)

access control: 
   * login with ldap
   * protect by list of users
   * with date ranges? (user foo allowed 2005-2007)
