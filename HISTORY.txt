Notes: major versions (1.5, 1.8) indicates that the python IRC bot have been
changed, and should be restarted after upgrade. Minor versions (1.8a, 1.8e) do
not modify the python engine so upgrades are done  by just unpacking the
distribution in place.

1.14b 11 Oct 2008
   fix of long standing bug: clicking on a search result would select the
       line underneath the good one

1.14a 09 Oct 2008
   search: do not use anymore the -a option of agrep, not available on recent 
       versions
   new web home is now: http://colas.nahaboo.net/Software/IrcLogger

1.14 19 Sep 2005
   Bugfix for python 2.3:
      * Crashed when somebody said in a channel: [LOGGER], off
        the format of args passed to the function had changed
      * Crashed when no more channels were logged
      * Would not remove a channel from the list of logged chans for next time
        when kicked out of it

1.13 10 may 2005
   New optional file CHANNELS.deny in logs dir to limit allowable channels

1.12a 15 Feb 2005
   MANUAL STEPS for upgrade:
     * from install dir; ln -s $PWD/irclogger_cgiparse $BIN
     (hint: do locate irclogger_log_search to find $BIN dirs)
   fix space not recognised in search on some systems

1.12  25 Jan 2005
   [off] at start of lines can now be case-independent

1.11  30 Sep 2004
    Logged channels status were not saved in case of hard machine crash

1.10a 08 Sep 2004
    new config variable "top" to set topmost back link
    new direct link to search in lchannel in the list of all chans

1.10  02 Aug 2004
    MANUAL STEPS for upgrade:
     * from install dir; ln -s $PWD/{irclogger_logs_cc,irclogger_totext} $BIN
    Minor change to the logger python bot: a debug message was still printed
        when socket was closed.
    install: typo in error message: ccho instead of echo
    irclogger-check: rewrite as a simple invocation of "irc" for more 
        robustness
    direct link to today log (no ?date=) in list of channels
    much faster directory listing with lots of logs (caches in 
        /tmp/.irclogger_logs_cache, settable as conf var cachedir
	(url)/irclogger_logs_cc clears the cache 
    default value for approximate search tolerance is 0 (1 was confusing some)
    new wording for logs list
    new form: contents only, useful for minutes
    in day html view, direct link to next and previous logs

1.9b 19 Mar 2004
    irclogger_log/<CHANNEL> now gives the current day log by a redirection
        so that the URL shown in the browser is perennial

1.9a 06 Jan 2004
    Bugfix in html rendering: 1st line was skipped

1.9  21 Nov 2003
    Change to the logger python bot: to disconnect the bot, the , or : after 
        logger name is now optional: you can say "[LOGGER] off", not just
	"[LOGGER]: off" or "[LOGGER], off"
1.8e 15 Nov 2003
    dates in URLs can now omit the day of week part:
        ...irclogger_log/twiki?date=2003-11-14 is sufficient, no need
	to have ...?date=2003-11-14,Fri
    line ranges can be separated by - only, no more :
1.8d 09 Nov 2003
    selected (highlighted) lines in the html web rendering can now be a range
	of values separated by a dash: -     
	e.g: ?date=2003-11-14,Fri&sel=42-63
1.8c 09 Nov 2003
    log files can now be compressed again.
    you should create a writable by all directory LOG/.exp: do
        for i in `locate irclogger.log`;do mkdir "${i%irclogger.log}.exp"
          chmod a+rw "${i%irclogger.log}.exp";done
1.8b 08 Nov 2003
    search is now done by agrep. As a consequence, logs cannot be gzipped
	anymore if you want to be able to search them (but gzipped files
	are still web-visible and  listable). But agrep has an approximate
	search very useful for IRC logs where typos abound
    you should unzip all you existing logs: go to you LOG dir, and do:
	gunzip */*.log.gz
1.8a 06 Nov 2003
    cgi scripts: uses the $FORM_var system of bashlib rather than the
        `param var` form which seemed to have problems on some machines
1.8 23 Oct 2003
    irclogger: on exit (^C or kill or disconnection) save the list of 
        monitored channels (space-separated list) in file LOG/CHANNELS.last, 
	so that (the new) irclogger-run can reconnect to them on startup.
	No need to restart irclogger if you do not need this feature.
    you will need to update your existing installed irclogger-run scripts with
        the provided patches/irclogger-run-1.8
1.7 23 Oct 2003
    irclogger: forces all channel names to lowercase, ignores previously made
        dirs that were not lowercase. You will have to rename them by hand
	before re-running irclogger.
	This was needed, otherwise if people created channels TWiki and then
	Twiki, the logs were in different dirs although they were the same IRC
	channels.
	No need to restart irclogger if you do not need this feature.
    added a small log converter from xchat format to mirc/irclogger one,
        xchat-to-mirc
1.6a 22 Oct 2003
    html: new output format: TWiki (makes definition lists in TWiki)
        done by new file (cgi bash)  irclogger_totwiki
    Update instructions: make a symbolic link to this file from the BIN dirs:
        in all BINs, do a: ln -s /usr/local/irclogger/irclogger_totwiki .
1.6 21 Oct 2003
    Minor fixs: (python) online bot help gives the URL of the logs
    Niceties to the html page (user manual)
    Decided to go to a major/minor version numbering (no changes to python
        on minor versions)
1.5 20 Oct 2003
    published on the web at http://koala.ilog.fr/irclogger
    entry "irclogger" in freshmeat.net.
1.4 09 Oct 2003
    install script
    irclogger change: log message put in a single line to avoid flooding
         server on startup when initially logging many channels
1.3 04 Oct 2003
    BIN/irclogger.conf variable confdir renamed as logsdir
    (you need to rename the variable in your existing config files when 
    upgrading)
1.2 13 Sep 2003
    should now quit properly on deconnections and not hang indefinitely:
        modified loop code to emit a ping every 60s (tick)
    do not log mess to self even if not the same case
    html: proper per week separation, sunday & saturday smaller
1.1 12 Sep 2003
    Putting a file PUBLIC in a channel log dir makes it unprotectable
1.0 11 Sep 2003
    First fonctional release. 
    Installed on irc.ilog.fr intranet, and on #twiki on overnet
